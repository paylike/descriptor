## What is it?

The descriptor is used as output on the bank statement.

## How is it validated?

The descriptor is validated against the following criteria:

- It can only have a length of 22 or less
- It can only contain ASCII printable characters (see [charaters](#characters))

### Characters

```
a-z
A-Z
0-9
! # $ % &
( ) * + ,
- . / : ;
< = > ? @
[ ] ^ _ `
{ | } ~
```

## Where is it used?

A descriptor is set in the following places:

1. On your merchant account
2. On a transaction for the reservation
3. On each capture of a transaction

The descriptor on the account (1) acts as a default if you do not supply a
descriptor for the transaction (2).

If you omit the descriptor for a capture (3) it will default to that on the
transaction (2).

As such, only the merchant account's descriptor is mandatory.

## Usage

Make sure to tag any dependency on this library with the current version to
ensure future installs of your application will work. Like so:

```json
"dependencies": {
	"paylike-descriptor": "srcagency/descriptor#v1.0.x"
}
```

The above entry will keep you on the `1.0.x` branch which will not have
breaking changes merged.

```js
var descriptor = require('paylike-descriptor');

descriptor.isValid('Paylike.io'); // true
descriptor.isValid('Â£'); // false

descriptor.errorMessage // 'Invalid descriptor (see https://github.com/paylike/descriptor)'

descriptor.maxLength // 22

descriptor.regex // /^[\x20-\x7E]{0,22}$/
```
